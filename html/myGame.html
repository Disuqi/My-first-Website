                <p lang="en-GB">Not too long ago I started learning game development, and after learning the basics I decided to start making my own video game. I just started making this game so I wouldn't even call it a game yet, however I would still like to share
                    with you what I have done so far. </p>

                <p lang="en-GB">I have been playing League of Legends for 5 years now and I really like the game and the characters. Every character in League of Legends has his own story and I think that most of them are really interesting; However there isn't a signle
                    video game or cartoon to tell these amazing stories. So I tought why not make a game myself, about the story of my favourite character, and so I started making this game about Yasuo(my favourite character in League of Legends).</p>

                <p lang="en-GB">The main character is Yasuo, so the first thing I did was make a couple of sprites, and here they are, let me know what you think and which one is your favourite</p>
